# Zathura

Homebrew formulae to install zathura and plugins on Mac OS X

## Installation steps

### Tap this repository
```sh
brew tap homebrew-zathura/zathura
```

### Install zathura
```sh
brew install zathura
```

With Synctex:
```sh
brew install zathura --with-synctex
```

### Install and link one of the two plugins

For poppler:
```sh
brew install zathura-pdf-poppler
mkdir -p $(brew --prefix zathura)/lib/zathura
ln -s $(brew --prefix zathura-pdf-poppler)/libpdf-poppler.dylib $(brew --prefix zathura)/lib/zathura/libpdf-poppler.dylib
```

For mupdf:
```sh
brew install zathura-pdf-mupdf
mkdir -p $(brew --prefix zathura)/lib/zathura
ln -s $(brew --prefix zathura-pdf-mupdf)/libpdf-mupdf.dylib $(brew --prefix zathura)/lib/zathura/libpdf-mupdf.dylib
```

### OSX_native_integration

The OSX native integration (dock, window manager) has been added to the develop branch of zathura.
You can install it by
```sh
# unlink installed zathura and girara
brew unlink girara
brew unlink zathura

# install HEAD
brew install girara --HEAD
brew install zathura --HEAD
mkdir -p $(brew --prefix zathura)/lib/zathura
ln -s $(brew --prefix zathura-pdf-poppler)/libpdf-poppler.dylib $(brew --prefix zathura)/lib/zathura/libpdf-poppler.dylib
```

### Copying to clipboard
Add the following to your `~/.config/zathura/zathurarc`:
```sh
set selection-clipboard clipboard
```

### Operation not supported error

If you are seeing errors like this:

```sh
# error: Can not copy to temporary file: Operation not supported
```

Try using an absolute path to the document:
```sh
zathura document.pdf
# error: Can not copy to temporary file: Operation not supported

# Try:
zathura /path/to/document.pdf
```

## Known Issues
Currently plugins are installed in the zathura folder, which means that uninstalling a plugin does not work.

Work on frameless windows and an improved app bundle experience are coming in the future.
